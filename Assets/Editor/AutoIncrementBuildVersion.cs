	 * 
	 * Simple version-incrementing service for Unity Cloud Build that is designed to run on git and Unity Cloud Build.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Requirements:
	 * 1) Place the commit.sh file in your Unity project root directory 
	 * 2) Place this file at Editor/AutoIncrementBuildVersion.cs
	 * 3) It expects that you are using git for version control already, and simply commits back to the branch it is already using
	 *
